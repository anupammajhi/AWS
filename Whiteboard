As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the AWS CLI doesn't provide a direct command to add a security group to an existing VPC endpoint. Security groups are typically associated with EC2 instances, and VPC endpoints have their own network controls.

If you need to control access to a VPC endpoint, you can manage it through its policy. You can use the `modify-vpc-endpoint` command to update the policy associated with a VPC endpoint.

Here's an example command:

```bash
aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint --vpc-endpoint-id YourVpcEndpointId --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":"*","Action":"*","Resource":"*"}]}'
```

Replace `YourVpcEndpointId` with the actual ID of your VPC endpoint, and adjust the policy document according to your security requirements.

Always refer to the latest AWS CLI documentation for any updates or changes after my last knowledge update in January 2022.
